/**
 * When items are moved around by a creative mode player, the client just tells the server to set a stack to a specific item.
 * This means that if the client thinks it's holding a stick, it will instruct the server to set the slot to a stick.
 * Even if the stick is supposed to represent another item. To fix this, we store the original full itemstack inside
 * the polyd itemstack and restore it when we receive the packet.
 * @see io.github.theepicblock.polymc.impl.PolyMapImpl#getClientItem(ItemStack, ServerPlayerEntity, ItemLocation)
